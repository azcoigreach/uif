=================

This file contains some quick installation hints for
the uif package.

Download:
 You can get the newest version at http://lug.mfh-iserlohn.de/uif.

Dependencies:
 In order to use the script, you need iptables, perl,
 NetAddr::IP (>=3.0) and Net::LDAP.

 the Makefile and do a "make install". If you want to start uif during
 bootup you should add the needed links in /etc/rc*. See file "uif"
 for a working init script.
