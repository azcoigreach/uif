uif for Debian
--------------

This package has been developed for a diskless router system and provides
a mechanism to create and simplify packetfilter rules. It forces you to
provide names for every value you use in order to make firewalls less
confusing.

There is some ldap support build in, to handle a big farm of diskles router
configurations. Use uif(8) and information provided in /usr/share/doc/uif
to configure the firewall fitting your needs.
